# newspaper-esque website made for my friend's request

Dialectic is a newspaper catered towards adults discussing topics such as politics, society, and more,
Written by Sarah Razack and consultant (possibly?) Jacob Shuster. Website by Adishree Das
Inspired by newspaper websites like NYT and the Washington Post
I will delete all the test articles once the website is reviewed!
Will later maybe be moved to thedialectic.xyz, thedialectic.space, or thedialectic.online

NOTE: AI used for trying (and failing) to make app mobile friendly, and help with debugging firebase errors


Password to add articles is 123Loveandcyanide (you can add something to test if you want, everything will be deleted later anyways so idc)
